# Mobile End User License Agreement (EULA) — Draft Summary

This summary captures the clauses I need for the iOS and Android store submissions. Full legal text should match our Terms of Service, but the key points are tracked here so I can plug them into App Store Connect / Google Play and the in-app “Legal” screen.

## 1. License Grant
- Non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the app on devices you own or control.
- iOS: limited to devices associated with the user’s Apple ID and permitted under the App Store Terms of Service.
- Android: limited to devices linked to the user’s Google account and permitted under Google Play terms.

## 2. Restrictions
- No reverse engineering, copying, reselling, or distributing the app.
- No automated scraping or misuse of Junkyard Watchdog data.
- Comply with all applicable laws when using the app.

## 3. Data Collection & Privacy

## 5. Termination

## Next Steps
