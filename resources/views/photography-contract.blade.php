The only way to add or change this agreement is to do so in writing, signed by all the Parties. If the Parties want to waive one provision of this agreement, that does not mean that any other provision is also waived.

        <h3>Scope of Work</h3>
        <p>This contract is for services and products related to a photography shoot, hereinafter referred to as the &quot;<strong>Shoot</strong>&quot;, to take place at the following time and place.</p>
        <p>The Photographer and the Client are to arrive for the Shoot at 9:30 AM at Indiana State House on 10/29/2016.</p>
        <p>The Photographer agrees to edit and deliver a minimum of 40 edited photos for the Client to view after the Shoot, and is not required to provide more than this number of images. The photographer will not provide any unedited or &quot;RAW&quot; files. The Photographer will make every reasonable effort to correct exposure, color, tone, contrast, sharpness, and cropping of all delivered photographs to the liking of the Client. The Photographer will not selectively edit portions, remove or add people or objects, or otherwise &quot;Photoshop&quot; individual photographs.</p>
        <h3>Image Delivery</h3>
        <p>Services include editing and retouching at the Photographer's discretion. An online gallery with two image sets (Original full resolution images + web-ready resized images) will be available to the Client no more than 14 days after the date of the Shoot. Client will be able to download or share the images directly from the gallery. Client's online gallery will be active/available for 2 months, and all downloads should be done within this time. Images from the session will be kept on a backup storage for 1 year, after which the Photographer cannot guarantee the retrieval of them.</p>
        <h3>Fees</h3>
        <p>In consideration for the photography services provided by the Photographer, the Client agrees to pay $150. The Photographer agrees to not advertise the availability of this same time slot to any other potential clients. The balance of the payment for photography services must be paid in full no later than 7 days after the Shoot. If the Client is failed to pay on time without a prior discussion with the Photographer, 30% of the original payment due will be charged as a late fee. The payment can be accepted via cash, Venmo, PayPal, Facebook Payment, or Chase QuickPay.</p>
        <h3>Retainer</h3>
        <p>A retainer fee of $0 is required for the shoot and due by 2 weeks prior to the day of the event. This is a <strong>non-refundable retainer</strong>. In the event of cancellation, the retainer paid is non-refundable. It shall be liquidated for damages to the Photographer in the event of a cancellation, or breach of contract by the Client. No date is reserved until a retainer is received. The retainer shall be applied towards the total cost of the service to be rendered. The balance of the complete package price must be paid by the agreed date.</p>
        <h3>Change of Date or Venue</h3>
        <p>The Photographer must be notified immediately of any changes in schedule or location, at least 2 days prior to the scheduled date of the event. Notification of any changes can be made by phone or email. If an email is sent, a confirmation of receipt must be sent back by the Photographer in writing or via email. It is the client’s responsibility to confirm all arrangements at least 2 days prior to the event. In the event of a change of address or contact information (time, etc.) as listed, the Client must notify the Photographer. <br />The Photographer kindly asks that the Client gets in touch with the Photographer 2 days prior to the date of the event in order to touch base and go over last minute details. The Photographer will make every effort to contact the Client, but it is the Client’s responsibility to contact the Photographer to confirm all events and times.</p>
        <h3>Cancellation</h3>
        <p>There shall be <strong>no</strong> refund of the retainer after the signing of the Agreement and the reservation of the photography date. If the event is canceled within 24 hours of the Shoot, the client shall pay the balance of the contract due to the high probability that the Photographer will not be able to further book that date. Once a balance is paid, it is <strong>non-refundable</strong>. Any other arrangements shall be discussed between the Client and the Photographer. All arrangements will be put in writing. Cancellation must be in writing even if a phone call was made to inform the Photographer of the cancellation.</p>
        <h3>Failure to Perform</h3>
        <p>The parties agree to cheerful cooperation and communication for the best possible result within the definition of this assignment.

        <p>The Photographer is not responsible for lost photo opportunities due to other cameras or flashes, the lateness of the clients or other principles.

It is acknowledged that any lists submitted to the Photographer will be used for organizational purposes only and in no way represent photography that will actually be produced.</p>
        <p>The Photographer will do its best to fulfill all requests but can make no guarantees all images will be delivered.

The Photographer will not be held accountable for not photographing desired people if there is no one to assist in identifying people or gathering people for photographs. The Photographer is not responsible if key individuals fail to appear or cooperate during photography sessions or for missed images due to details not revealed to the Photographer.</p>
