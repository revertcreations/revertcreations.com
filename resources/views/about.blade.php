            My previous position I worked as a full-stack web developer building ticketing
            software with the great people at

            team at Hagerty, where I have cultivated a strong proficiency in a diverse array of technologies,
            including
            Docker, Kubernetes, Heroku, and Git. My expertise extends across various programming
            languages, encompassing Javascript, NodeJS, PHP, Bash, and Swift. Additionally, I am
            well-versed in essential software tools such as DevTools, Xcode, GitHub, Cloudinary,
            Vagrant, and Linux.

            These tools collectively empower me to adeptly construct sophisticated, interactive,
            responsive, and secure applications. With such a robust skill set, the only boundaries
            that remain are those of my own imagination.
