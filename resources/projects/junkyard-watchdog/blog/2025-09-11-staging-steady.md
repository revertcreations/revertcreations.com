# Sep 11, 2025 – Staging, Steady As She Goes

Quick check-in day. Staging’s humming on DigitalOcean with the deploy workflow rolled back to the stable script, production deploys now require a manual green light, and the admin UI finally feels like it belongs to the same product. Runs auto-refresh, timeout hints surface, and the docs call out how to use the new diagnostics tools without guessing.

The real focus was planning the next punch list: finish the iOS push credential dance, run a staging smoke with the new workflows, and maybe sketch out the Pull-A-Part source. Nothing flashy, just making sure the pipes are tight before moving on.
