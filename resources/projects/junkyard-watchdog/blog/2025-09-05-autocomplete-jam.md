# Sep 5, 2025 – Autocomplete Jam Session

Coffee in hand, I dove straight into the make/model picker. The goal: make it feel like a native app, not a busted spreadsheet. I sketched out aliases so “Chevy” and “Chevrolet” finally hug it out, added indexes so the search feels instant, and let the API return all the years in one shot when the UI asks nicely.

```php
if ($request->boolean('include_years')) {
    $models = $models->withAggregate('years as years', 'GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT year ORDER BY year DESC)');
}
```

Once the backend behaved, I gave the autocomplete a makeover—dark mode friendly popovers, a chill FAB on mobile, and themed hover states so drifting through suggestions doesn’t feel like spelunking. The plan from here is to keep merging aliases and get keyboard navigation dialed, but for today I’m just happy the picker finally matches the vibe of the rest of the app.
