# Sep 6, 2025 – Types, Clarity, and Calling It

After the Tamagui experiment, I put the UI back on Paper and went hunting for the TypeScript warnings that CI kept grumbling about. TanStack Query v5 changed how `keepPreviousData` works, so I swapped it for `placeholderData`, tightened the FlashList props, and the red squiggles finally gave up.

```ts
const { data = placeholder, isFetching } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['inventory', filters],
  queryFn: fetchInventory,
  placeholderData: keepPreviousData,
});
```

The rest of the day was about strategy. I wrote down the plan for push tokens, theme polish, and the watchlist toggle work so we stop ping-ponging between epics. It wasn’t a flashy session, just the kind where you clean your tools and line up the next few moves. Needed that.
