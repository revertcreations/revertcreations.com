# Sep 5, 2025 – Afternoon UI Glow-Up

Post-lunch energy went straight into sanding rough edges. Every screen got the compact PageHeader treatment so titles stop screaming, the inventory list moved to Paper’s List.Item with that little NEW chip tucked in the corner, and the watchlist picked up inline delete actions so the overflow menu can chill.

I also finally gave the autocomplete input the love it deserved: a tiny spinner when the network wakes up, an obvious clear button, and keyboard navigation that actually tracks which row you’re on. The Paper theme tokens got broadened too—now error states and outline variants have some personality without blowing up dark mode.

Still on the docket: sweep the app for stray Pressables pretending to be buttons and tune ripples/accessibility labels. But for a Friday afternoon pass, everything feels lighter and more consistent, which was the whole mission.
