# Sep 21, 2025 – My Car-Part Rabbit Hole

I went into Sunday promising myself “just a little recon.” By **4:05 PM EDT** (commit `a61e61d`) I had accidentally built an importer. Classic.

The plan was to poke around Car-Part’s mobile site, scribble some notes, and keep things light. I dumped their `parts.js` file into `.codex/carpart/parts_catalog.json`, sketched the flow in my notebook, and realized the hierarchy was begging to live in our database. Decision made: if we’re going to talk to this data later, might as well make it comfortable now.

```php
$category = AutomotivePartCategory::updateOrCreate(
    ['parent_id' => $parentId, 'slug' => $slug],
    ['name' => $name]
);
```

Watching the importer climb through each nested category felt like untangling a thrift-store necklace. I added a `--dry-run` switch because I know future Trever likes to peek without messing anything up. The tests kept me honest: if a part code shows up twice, it only gets one seat at the table.

The casual call I made: store the real Car-Part payloads under `backend/resources/catalog` so staging doesn’t care whether my `.codex` folder exists. That keeps deployments boring (in a good way). It’s not glamorous, but now when we finally wire a UI for picking catalog parts, the data is already waiting with labeled name tags.

Moral of the day: sometimes “I’ll just explore” ends with a brand-new command, and that’s fine. Exploration is the fun part anyway.
