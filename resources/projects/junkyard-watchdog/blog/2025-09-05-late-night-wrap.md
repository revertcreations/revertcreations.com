# Sep 5, 2025 – Late-Night Wrap-Up

I should’ve closed the laptop, but the app was so close to feeling cohesive that I kept going. I ripped out the goofy Theme tab, tucked the switcher onto the Account screen where it actually belongs, and made sure every major surface was running on Paper components with our brand colors mapped into MD3.

Autocomplete finally scrolls the active item into view, the watchlist dialog looks like it was designed on purpose, and the inventory list’s right column now stacks the row badge and NEW label without fighting for space. I jotted down the remaining lint/a11y cleanup so Monday-me knows what’s left.

No huge fireworks—just the satisfaction of seeing everything line up. Worth the extra hour.
