# Sep 17, 2025 – Admin Refresh & Future Plans

Gave the admin area a well-deserved spa day. Every page—from Sources to Client Logs—now shares the same layout, and the quick actions are where your thumb expects them. While the polish dried, I queued up the welcome and day-seven lifecycle emails so staging drips feel real once Mailgun credentials land.

Most of the afternoon was spent writing: monetization notes, telemetry roadmap, vehicle catalog expansion. Not the most glamorous work, but having the plans saved in `MONETIZATION.md` and friends means I can revisit them without digging through my brain. Next up is wiring the telemetry pipeline for real and getting SMTP verified, but today felt like a nice reset.
