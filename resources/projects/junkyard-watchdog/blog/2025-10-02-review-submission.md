Wrapped up the last blockers and finally shipped the 1.0 build off to App Review. Knocked out the 12.9" iPad screenshots, answered the App Privacy questionnaire in detail (every data type, why we store it, and where), and set the pricing/category combo to Tier 0 under Shopping with Utilities as a backup.

Along the way I wrote `docs/launch/app-store-privacy.md` and a device-specific screenshot README so future capture sessions aren’t a scavenger hunt. As soon as the privacy matrix was done, App Store Connect accepted the build for review. Now it’s just a waiting game—monitor for questions, prep the canned responses, and get the launch checklist ready for go time.
