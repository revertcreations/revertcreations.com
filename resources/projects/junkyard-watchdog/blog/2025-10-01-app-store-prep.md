# Oct 1, 2025 – App Store Prep Marathon

Today was all about teeing things up for App Review. Locked in the App Store copy (subtitle, keywords, privacy/support URLs) and mirrored the final text in `docs/launch/app-store-prep.md` so we don’t lose it later. Seeded staging with a `ScreenshotDemoSeeder` so every tab looks hero-shot ready, and double-checked the reviewer account details in App Store Connect.

Push credentials, Expo tokens, the works—they all got verified so TestFlight matches production. The two lingering tasks are the iPad 12.9" screenshots and the App Preview video storyboard, but at least the list is honest now.

Release plan is to auto-launch once review approves; no manual hold. Privacy answers stay conservative until the telemetry stack ships, which keeps things simple. All in all, a solid paperwork day.
