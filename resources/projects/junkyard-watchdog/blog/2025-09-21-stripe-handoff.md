# Sep 21, 2025 – Stripe Checkout, But Make It Chill

I woke up thinking I’d sneak in a “quick Stripe tweak” before lunch. You already know how that goes. Around **1:10 PM EDT** I pushed commit `4bf5cc7`, which basically means I finally admitted the native app needed a friendly landing page when Stripe bounces back. The rule of the day: if it isn’t a `junkyardwatchdog://` link, it doesn’t get through. Everything else gets politely turned away before it can cause trouble.

```php
return response()->view('billing.redirect', [
    'target' => $target,
    'fallback' => $this->resolveFallbackUrl(),
    'state' => $this->extractState($target),
]);
```

The vibe I wanted was “you’re done, go back to the app” with a little sparkle. That meant a glassy, coral-gradient button and just enough copy to let folks know if they hit cancel, we won’t guilt-trip them. It’s seriously just a fancy trampoline for deep links, but it feels good.

Once that page was live, I started worrying about forgetting to test it next week. Commit `bd7ac2a` landed at **2:51 PM EDT** and brought a Playwright script that signs up a fake account, spins up a checkout session, and replays Stripe’s webhooks so our plan states flip from Free → Pro → back again. The big call looked like this:

```ts
const returnPage = await request.get(
  `/billing/return?target=${encodeURIComponent(APP_SUCCESS_URL)}`
);
expect(returnPage.ok()).toBeTruthy();
```

Was it overkill? Maybe. But future-me loves rolling up to a deploy with receipts. The decision tree was simple: if I can’t explain what happens when someone closes Stripe on their phone, I can’t ship it. Now I can chill. Stripe hands the user back to us, the smoke test keeps me honest, and I still got tacos for dinner.
